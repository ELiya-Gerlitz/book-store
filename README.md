# book-store
Layered Rest API book-store withGitonlyForFrontend 


this is the umpteenth time I open a gitHub repository.
This time I did the followings:
1) didn't add the git-ignore at the opening of the repo.
2) left the gitIgnore in the frontend code.
3) left the node_modules in the Frontend.
4)Deleted the node_modules in the Backend.
5) git push moshe master    AND NOT git push moshe -u -f master 
6) did not include again the url in the push command. i.e. NOT included the url after the word moshe.
7) Did it in the CMD and NOT in the terminal.
